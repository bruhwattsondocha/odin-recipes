    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Made with red cabbage, green bell pepper, and tomato, this recipe is almost as colorful as Dolly Parton's song "Coat of Many Colors."</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 medium head red cabbage, chopped (10 cups)</li>
        <li>1 medium green bell pepper, seeded and chopped (1 cup)</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, chopped (1 cup)</li>
        <li>1 cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cider vinegar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup powdered sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more to taste</li>
        <li>1 large tomato, chopped (1 3/4 cups)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine cabbage, green pepper, and onion in a large bowl. In a small bowl, whisk together mayonnaise, vinegar, powdered sugar, salt, and black pepper until smooth. Pour dressing over vegetables, tossing well to combine. Cover and chill at least 2 hours to allow everything to marinate.</li>
        <li>When ready to serve, gently stir in tomato and season to taste with additional salt and pepper. (Chill, covered, up to 5 days.)</li>
    </ol>
